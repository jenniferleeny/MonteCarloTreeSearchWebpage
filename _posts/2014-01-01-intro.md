# Background

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an algorithm used to solve perfect information sequential games. More specifically, MCTS takes as input a game and a state in the game and approximates the best move to make in that state of the game. MCTS has been shown to be exceptionally good at playing the game of Go, so that is the game we will be testing on.  MCTS is an anytime algorithm, meaning that it can be ran for as many or as few iterations as desired. The solution that the algorithm converges to improves in quality as more iterations are ran, so if you can run multiple iterations in parallel then this should improve the algorithm?s rate of convergence and would be a source of parallelism. 

Additionally, MCTS evaluates a state in the game by performing random rollouts from that state. A random rollout is where each we just simulate each player playing completely randomly until the game is finished and using the result of this playout as a heuristic for the value of the starting state. The idea is that if the starting state of the game is favorable to one player, then that player is more likely to win if both players play randomly from that state, so in expectation this should be a good heuristic. If multiple random rollouts are performed for the given state, then we?ll get an evaluation that has lower variance and more accurately represents who is favored in that state of the game. So running multiple rollouts in parallel is again another source of parallelism.
